# Shared Rust port plan

## Objective

Move UMF-owned executable semantics to one shared Rust implementation and expose
them through the Rust CLI, native Python, Node/Bun and browser WebAssembly
interfaces. The current passing Rust library is an implementation milestone, not
completion of the port. Wrappers handle host admission and presentation; Rust owns
model, validation, adapter, projection and generator decisions under ADR-006.
Delete historical qualification reports, retirement ledgers, source custody
chains and receipt-based build gates at the owner's request. Keep executable
regression cases as ordinary fixtures.

ADR-006, the PRD, cross-cutting requirements, architecture, TP-001 and the affected
adapter contracts govern behavior. Preserve exact native values, unknown content
and explicit resource boundaries. Core is 0.10.0; the native Python candidate is
0.10.4 with matching dependent-package pins.

## Implementation slices

1. Complete the current Rust foundation. Run the default Cargo library and CLI
   suite under the stable test profile (`opt-level = 1`, debug assertions and
   overflow checks enabled), check production boundaries and generated metamodel
   outputs, and verify source packaging and an independent Rust consumer. Use
   this evidence to support the following kernel and host-activation work; the
   complete port and release remain the objective.
2. Activate existing native kernels through tagged wire and CLI routes, starting
   with OpenAPI and LinkML/ODCS. Keep exact UTF-16/value transport, unknown
   content and caller controls. For each new route, run one end-to-end operation
   and one malformed-request refusal before broader integration tests. Add the
   GraphQL host callback bridge so Rust completes edit prevalidation before the
   host callback runs.
3. Implement the remaining semantic families in reviewable cuts. Start parallel
   RDF semantic work (JSON-LD, then SHACL and OWL) on the existing RDF core and
   relational/TableSpec work on the existing core-ideal kernels. Complete the
   remaining Delta/Iceberg/Spark behavior, cross-format projections, action and
   security operations, and TypeSpec/Smithy compiler-backed operations. A source
   archive or parser alone is not completion of compiler or assembly semantics.
4. Activate every implemented family through the shared Rust API, CLI where
   applicable, Python, Node/Bun and browser WASM. Replace wrapper-side semantic
   execution rather than retaining a hidden JavaScript or Python fallback.
   Generate language-specific clients from the Rust-owned compiler and rules.
5. At integration points, run the affected functional baselines and complete
   current Rust, binding, packaging and real-browser suites. Test additions
   target new capabilities and failures; do not repeat broad historical
   qualification matrices after each small edit. Run checks locally without
   GitHub Actions.

Use the existing worktree. Luna handles implementation; Sol plans and reviews.
Use one expensive build/test job at a time. Preserve user-owned `.tmp/`.

## Execution order

Sol owns planning, admission, integration and review. Luna owns parallel
implementation and focused test additions. Give each implementation lane one
coherent callable capability, its exact existing contract, and one normal
workflow plus a refusal baseline. Keep implementation lanes active while the
shared native/browser build slot verifies the last admitted batch.

Run a metadata/compiler check before optimized native builds. Batch independent
new cases into one host build. After a case passes, exclude it from repair runs
unless a later change affects its behavior or dependency. Do not reopen broad
conformance campaigns during implementation. Run complete suites once the
remaining callable operations are integrated, and repair only actual failures.

Current integration order:

1. Verify the four repaired normal workflows from the last batch: G01 retained
   Field backfill, G11 selected replacements, PostgreSQL→Avro and Arrow↔Spark.
   G01 emitted NOT NULL twice; G11 validated selected markers against an
   incomplete discovery sequence. Keep the existing refusal guards intact.
2. Admit reviewed Security authority/catalog/purpose/obligation kernels and the
   next projections: PostgreSQL row→JSON Schema, Parquet→Avro and the composed
   source→Avro→TableSpec operation. Arrow uses the current FlatBuffer model
   profile; its integration JSON schema is a different adapter.
3. Keep Luna implementation lanes on the missing FlatBuffer binary codec and
   cross-format projections, DDD GraphQL and subsequent binding projections.
   Sol completes the current inventory compiler after the earlier Luna attempt
   failed to implement its actual API. Activate existing Rust core-ideal kernels
   through exact public default routes; do not rewrite implemented primitives.
4. Delete public reference/candidate executable exports and their SDK bundles
   once current defaults are callable. Complete local package/browser/consumer
   integration, review, merge current main and publish binaries without Actions.

## Latest focused capability results

The production TypeScript and selected Rust compiler preflight pass. The latest
native batch passed 13 new Node baseline cases: legacy Security interpretation,
access/collection/write and registration; Security V1/V2 disclosure transport;
Avro↔TableSpec; SQL Server→Avro and SQL Server→DDL. Python's embedded source
resource closure passes. These cases are excluded from repair runs.

Four cases failed: the two migration compiler normals, PostgreSQL→Avro and
Arrow↔Spark. The migration and PostgreSQL repairs are in source. The Arrow repair
adds the missing Rust owner for the current FlatBuffer model adapter and routes
both projections through it. These repairs still require their focused runtime
check. FlatBuffer binary encode/decode remains a separate missing operation.

Action Manifest construction/inspection/assessment and refusal pass. Bit128
carrier/model projection and recovery plus file-record encode/decode/refusal now
pass, in addition to the earlier full-row and classifier cases. Security V2
source migration/transport, reviewed-value digest and public migration
compile/verify/refusal also pass. Keep these green cases out of subsequent repair
runs unless their dependencies change.

The complete tools/test TypeScript project still has fixture and mock typing
errors. Repair those during final integration; the production compiler remains
an admission gate for each new batch.

Sol reviews each source cut before admission. Metadata checks precede native
code generation; static checks do not substitute for callable runtime results.

## Current callable baseline

| Family | Current implemented and passing workflows | Remaining work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Registry/document | Rust-owned default package validation, caller callbacks, read/write and refusal pass through Node. | Final browser/installed-package integration. |
| Native formats | OpenAPI, LinkML, ODCS, TableSpec, SQL Server, RDF, JSON-LD, SHACL/OWL, Avro, GraphQL, Parquet, Iceberg and Delta have Rust routes with ordinary source/edit/export or validation baselines. | Finish still-missing semantics listed below and final host/package activation. |
| Compiler hosts | TypeSpec compile/graph and actual pinned Smithy assembly/selection pass in Chromium. Supplied PostgreSQL browser parse→callback failure→retry→edit→deparse passes after making the runtime asset loader relocatable. | Final release-profile SDK and remaining callback routes. |
| Delta recovery | JSONL sidecar, Parquet actions/checkpoint and multipart routes pass focused wire/Node tests; new browser sidecar/checkpoint/multipart cases pass. Mapped rename passes Node. | Final package and remaining browser/Python activation. |
| Spark | Rust import/inspect/get/edit/export and metadata/collation rename pass focused wire and Node public workflows, with unknown metadata and numeric tokens preserved. Invalid target refusal passes. | Browser/Python activation. |
| DDD JSON Schema | Native projection → inspection → node access → edit → write/read workflow and refusal pass through Node; focused wire cases pass. | Browser/Python activation and the separate DDD GraphQL/PostgreSQL projections. |
| Bit128 | Classifier, Field authoring, logical binding inspection and public full-row encode/decode/refusal pass native baselines. | Carrier/model/file projection/recovery now pass Node; final host activation. |
| Action Plan | Rust prepare/inspect/assess, blocked dependency, complete read-Field obligations and caller diagnostic handling pass Rust, Node and staged Python; Chromium prepare/inspect/blocked passes. | Final package integration and dependent Manifest activation. |
| Action authoring | Node declaration → inspect → edit → assessment, custom caller validation and duplicate identity refusal pass with supported Actions. | Browser/Python/package activation. |
| Saga | Supported Action declaration → inspect → edit → assessment and opaque-source refusal pass through Node, CLI and installed Python. JSON object member order no longer changes parameter identity. | Browser/package activation. |
| Action selectors/rules/bulk | Native selector compilation, typed input admission, prepared identity selection, rule compilation and bulk-outcome validation pass all eight new Node normal/refusal cases. | Browser/package activation. |
| Security | Native function/value/query properties, source/parameter/domain activation and V2 source migration/transport pass Node baselines; basic query join passes Chromium. | Legacy policy/evaluation/registration and V1/V2 disclosure pass Node; authority/catalog/purpose/obligation cut and final host activation remain. |
| Migration and row-scope | Discovery `.2`/`.3`/`.4`, G04 recipes, caller row-scope, compiler `.4`/`.5`/`.7`, public compile/verify and reviewed digest pass focused baselines. G02 orders revoke before column changes and grant afterward. | G01 `.3` ordering and G11 `.6` supported replacement baseline; inventory compilation/discovery/serialization/verification. |
| Python/CLI/package | Native adapters, Action Plan, callback semantics, Delta/RDF/Avro/PostgreSQL workflows and sdist include closure pass local focused cases without JavaScript on PATH. | Complete installed wheel/sdist, supported local platform builds and final CLI consumer. |

### Remaining public executable export queue (current V4 barrel)

This queue names the current TypeScript-executed V4 exports in the Action, Security, Projection and migration families. Static package constants, type exports and host Registry registration helpers are omitted. A source-level native primitive is a reuse point, not proof that the composite public operation is callable. Each row closes only after its exact public export reaches Rust in Node and browser with one normal/refusal baseline; Python/CLI routes join where that API is exposed there.

| Cut | Exact public exports | Rust owner / next change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Action Plan staged artifact/session | `prepareActionPlanModel`, `inspectActionPlan`, `assessActionPlan` | Rust artifact/claim kernel and explicit Registry/selection session; native, Node, Python and Chromium baselines pass. |
| Saga default activation | `inspectSagas`, `declareSaga`, `editSaga`, `assessSaga` | Rust kernels/codegen wire now own V4 defaults; Node, CLI and installed Python normal/refusal pass; browser/package activation remains. |
| Action declaration and assessment | `inspectActions`, `declareAction`, `editAction`, `assessAction` | Rust authoring/assessment kernel drives V4 defaults; supported Action workflow and caller callback/refusal baselines pass. |
| Action selector/expression | `admitActionInputs`, `compileActionRule`, `compileActionSelector`, `prepareActionIdentities`, `selectActionIdentity`, `actionFieldValueKey` | Rust default routes own all named operations; six new selector/identity/rule Node normal/refusal cases pass; browser/package activation remains. |
| Action manifest/bulk | `constructActionManifest`, `inspectActionManifest`, `assessActionManifest`, `validateBulkOutcome` | Bulk-outcome Rust validation passes both new Node cases. Manifest construction/inspection/assessment and retained Rust session refusals pass focused Node baselines. |
| Security existing-kernel activation | `composeSecurityRules`, `securityRefIdentity`, `resolveSecurityProtectionDomains`, `resolveSecurityProtectionSources`, `validateProtectionParameters`, `readProtectionSource`, `writeProtectionSource` | Existing `security_logic`, `security_domains`, `security_parameters`, `security_protection_source_binding` kernels/wires; add thin defaults with ordinary/refusal. |
| Security policy/source meaning | `inspectSecurityPolicy`, `requireSecurityInterpretation`, `inspectSecurityPolicyV2Source`, `upgradeSecurityPolicySource`, `downgradeSecurityPolicySource`, `readSecuritySource`, `writeSecuritySource`, `securityPolicyDependencies`, `securityIdentityTransportDependencies` | Generic native JSON/YAML transport exists, but policy/V2 migration and dependency closure decisions still need Rust kernels/defaults. |
| Security evaluation and authority | `evaluateSecurityAccess`, `evaluateSecurityCollection`, `evaluateSecurityWrite`, `evaluateSecurityPolicyV2LegacyAccess`, `SecurityAuthorityGuard`, `SecurityReadRegistration` | New Rust evaluation/stateful authority kernels with explicit caller capabilities; no JS policy decision fallback. |
| Security disclosure/catalog | `inspectProtectionCatalog`, `requireProtectionInterpretation`, `inspectProtectionObligations`, `inspectSecurityActionPurposes`, `validateSecurityDisclosure`, `encodeSecurityDisclosure`, `decodeSecurityDisclosure`, `inspectSecurityDisclosureV2`, `encodeSecurityDisclosureV2`, `decodeSecurityDisclosureV2` | Reuse native source/literal/parameter primitives; add missing disclosure/catalog/obligation semantic kernels and exact source retention. |
| Existing core-ideal defaults | Native classifiers/projections/recovery already exist for Avro, Parquet, PostgreSQL, SQL Server and TableSpec. | Activate exact published classify/project/verify/recover exports through those owners, replacing original TypeScript decisions. |
| Binding target projection | `projectBindingToDelta`, `projectBindingToIceberg`, `projectBindingToParquet`, `projectBindingToSqlServer`, `projectBindingTablesToSqlServer`, `projectBindingTablesAndIndexesToSqlServer`, `projectBindingTablesAndIndexesFromPlanToSqlServer`, `recoverBindingSqlServerNative`, `recoverBindingSqlServerSources`, `verifyBindingSqlServerProjection`, `validateSqlServerRelationshipLayout` | Native binding source/inspection and generic index projection are reuse points; target-specific composition/verification remains a Rust cut. |
| Binding index projection | `projectBindingIndexesToPostgresql`, `projectBindingIndexesToSqlServer`, `projectBindingIndexesAgainstSqlServerPlan` | Reuse `binding_index_projection::project_binding_indexes`; add target-specific DDL/catalog admission and public routes. |
| Bit128 projection | `classifyBit128NativeType`, `decodeBit128FileRecord`, `encodeBit128FileRecord`, `projectBit128CarrierSchema`, `recoverBit128CarrierProjection`, `projectBit128Model`, `recoverBit128ModelProjection` | Classifier, Field authoring, binding inspection, full-row and file encode/decode, carrier/model projection/recovery pass Node; final host activation remains. |
| DDD → GraphQL/PostgreSQL | `projectDddEntitiesToGraphql`, `projectDddToGraphql`, `recoverDddFromGraphql`, `recoverDddGraphqlNative`, `verifyDddGraphqlProjection`, `projectDddTablesToPostgresql`, `projectDddTablesAndIndexesToPostgresql`, `projectDddToPostgresql`, `recoverDddPostgresqlIdeal`, `recoverDddPostgresqlNative`, `verifyDddPostgresqlProjection`, `validatePostgresqlRelationshipLayout` | Reuse native GraphQL/PostgreSQL source adapters; DDD mapping and recovery/loss kernel is absent. |
| DDD → JSON Schema | `dddFieldBinding`, `projectDddToJsonSchema` | Native DDD mapping kernel and Node public projection/edit/read/write/refusal baselines pass; browser/Python activation remains. |
| Cross-format schema projections | `projectArrowToSpark`, `projectAvroToTableSpec`, `projectGraphqlInputToJsonSchema`, `projectJsonSchemaToProtobuf`, `projectOpenapiToJsonSchema`, `projectParquetToAvro`, `projectPostgresqlRowToJsonSchema`, `projectPostgresqlToAvro`, `projectSmithyToJsonSchema`, `projectSparkToArrow`, `projectSqlServerToAvro`, `projectSqlServerToDdl`, `projectTableSpecToAvro`, `projectToTableSpecViaAvro`, `projectTypeSpecToJsonSchema`, `createSmithyJavaScriptJsonSchemaBackend` | Reuse existing Rust format/source adapters and explicit compiler backends; add one Rust-owned mapping/loss kernel per coherent source→target relation. The Smithy backend factory remains a host capability, but projected status/source/loss belongs to Rust. |
| Table inventory migration | `compileTableInventoryMigration`, `discoverTableInventoryMigrationChanges`, `serializeTableInventoryMigration`, `verifyTableInventoryMigration`, `irreversiblePurgeDisclosure` | Separate new inventory kernel; `umf-codegen` current migration compiler does not own this public profile. |
| Migration digest and selected compiler | `reviewedValueDigest`, `compileTableMigration`, `verifyTableMigration` | Native canonical digest and public compile/verify/refusal pass. Compiler `.4`/`.5`/`.7` baselines pass; `.3` ordering and `.6` supported replacement baseline remain in repair. |

Host-only/static exports in these families: `actionExpressionLimits`, `actionsPackage`, `sagaPackage`, `createSagaResources`, `registerActions`, `registerSagas`, `protectionPackage`, `SECURITY_EXTENSION`, `securityPackage`, `securityV2Package`, and `securityRegistry`. Keep these as data/registration facades only; underlying validation and semantics must still use Rust. The broader `core-ideals` barrel has native classifier/recovery primitives in `umf-core` and needs a separate exact default-route audit, not a blanket new-kernel assignment.

## Remaining Port Work

Remaining work is the unclosed operations and host activation named above,
legacy executable surface retirement, complete local integration tests, review,
merge and publication. Scratch code and metadata checks alone do not close a
capability: its public operation must pass its focused current baseline.

## Acceptance

The full port is complete when every UMF-owned shared semantic operation in the
public TypeScript and Python surfaces has a Rust owner, its native behavior and
loss boundaries are tested, and supported Rust CLI, Python, Node/Bun and browser
WASM entry points invoke that owner. The published `./reference` export and
legacy `dist/umf.js` surface must also redirect or retire their executable
TypeScript semantics. The complete current Cargo, binding, packaging and
real-browser suites pass, and the released artifacts execute without a hidden
JavaScript or Python engine. A passing library milestone alone
does not satisfy this acceptance. No archived certificate, historical source
hash or retirement ledger is a prerequisite. Keep actual functional receipt
types and integrity checks required by public operations.
